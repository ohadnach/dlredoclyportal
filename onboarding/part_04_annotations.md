## Annotations

There are different types of annotations that you can create on the platform. 
In this introduction section we will focus on [classification](https://dataloop.ai/docs/classify-item)
and [bounding box](https://dataloop.ai/docs/create-bounding-box) and [polyline](https://dataloop.ai/docs/create-polygon)

1. [Setup](../tutorials/annotations_image/setup/chapter.md)
2. [Upload annotations](../tutorials/getting_started/sdk_overview/chapter.md#annotating-items) ( review only box and classification)
3. [Classification](../tutorials/annotations_image/classification_point_and_pose/chapter.md)
4. [Bounding box](../tutorials/annotations_image/bounding_box_and_cuboid/chapter.md)
5. [Polygon and polyline](../tutorials/annotations_image/polygon_and_polyline/chapter.md)


 
***Exercise:***

1. Get the dataset 
2. Get one specific image by its ID
3. Add a polygon
4. Get another image by its ID
5. Add a box
