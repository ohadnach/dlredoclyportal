## Data versioning

Dataloop provides data [versioning tools](https://dataloop.ai/docs/clone-merge-dataset?highlight=clone) to manage your data that you can use for golden training 
sets management, reproducibility, experimentation and many more. 

You can use [merge](https://sdk-docs.dataloop.ai/en/latest/repositories.html#dtlpy.repositories.datasets.Datasets.merge) and [clone](../tutorials/data_management/data_versioning/chapter.md#clone-datasets) also via SDK. 

***Exercise:***
1. Get a dataset
2. Clone dataset
3. Rename cloned dataset
4. Create a new dataset
5. Merge your original dataset with a new created one

> What will you learn next? 

1. [chapter 8](part_08_faas.md) will introduce you to our function as service feature. 

2. If you want to go deeper into known functionalities before you drive in more complex ones. We recommend to go over
[chapter 12](part_12_annotations_advanced.md) and [chapter 13](part_13_annotations_on_video.md) about advanced annotations. 
As well as to go over [chapter 14](part_14_advanced_filtering.md) to review advanced filtering, because it will be used a lot
in more advanced features.
