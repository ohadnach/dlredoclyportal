    In this tutorial we will download a public model from the AI library to inference and train on custom data locally.
    Here we will use a ResNet50 model.

    Start by installing the following packages if you don't have them installed already. The model adapter will use them later.
    torch
    torchvision
    imgaug
    scikit-image<0.18

    Then, import the modules required for the scripts in this tutorial.

    First, we create the Model entity for our project. You can view the public models in the public Dataloop Github.
