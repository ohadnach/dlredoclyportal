    # Training an Object Detection Model with YOLOv5
    In this tutorial we will download a public model from the AI library to inference and train on custom data locally.
    Here we will use a YOLOv5 model.

    Create a venv and install the requirements for the yolov5 package [here](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt/)
    Then, import the modules required for the scripts in this tutorial.

    We will use a public fruits dataset. We create a project and a dataset and upload the data with 3 labels of fruit.
    NOTE: You might need to change the location of the items, which currently points to the root of the documentation repository. If you downloaded the dtlpy documentation repo locally, this should work as-is.
