    # Data Versioning
    Dataloop's powerful data versioning provides you with unique tools for data management - clone, merge, slice & dice your files, to create multiple versions for various applications. Sample use cases include:
    Golden training sets management
    Reproducibility (dataset training snapshot)
    Experimentation (creating subsets from different kinds)
    Task/Assignment management
    Data Version "Snapshot" - Use our versioning feature as a way to save data (items, annotations, metadata) before any major process. For example, a snapshot can serve as a roll-back mechanism to original datasets in case of any error without losing the data.

    ## Clone Datasets
    Cloning a dataset creates a new dataset with the same files as the original. Files are actually a reference to the original binary and not a new copy of the original, so your cloud data remains safe and protected. When cloning a dataset, you can add a destination dataset, remote file path, and more...

    ## Merge Datasets
    Dataset merging outcome depends on how similar or different the datasets are.
    * Cloned Datasets - items, annotations, and metadata will be merged. This means that you will see annotations from different datasets on the same item.
    * Different datasets (not clones) with similar recipes - items will be summed up, which will cause duplication of similar items.
    * Datasets with different recipes - Datasets with different default recipes cannot be merged. Use the 'Switch recipe' option on dataset level (3-dots action button) to match recipes between datasets and be able to merge them.
