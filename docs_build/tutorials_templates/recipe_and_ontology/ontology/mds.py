    Ontology uses the ‘Labels’  entity, which is a python list object, and as such you can use python list methods such as sort(). Be sure to use ontology.update() after each python list action.

    Labels can be added with branched hierarchy to facilitate sub-labels at up-to 5 levels.
    Labels hierarchy is created by adding ‘.’ between parent and child labels.

    ## Attributes
    An attribute describes a label, without having to add more labels. For example “Car” is a label, but its color is an attribute. You can add multiple attributes to the ontology, and map it to labels. For example create the “color” attribute once, but have multiple labels use it.
    Attributes can be multiple-selection (e.g checkbox), single selection (radio button), value over slider, a yes/no question and free-text.
    An attribute can be set as a mandatory one, so annotators have to answer it before they can complete the item.

    ## Add attributes to the ontology
    The following example adds 1 attribute of every type, all as a mandatory attribute:
    * Multiple-choice attribute
    * Single-choice attributes
    * Slider attribute
    * Yes/no question attribute
    * Free text attribute
