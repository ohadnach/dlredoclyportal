    Since a recipe is linked with an ontology, it allows for making changes with labels and attributes. When the recipe is set as the default one for a dataset, the same applies for the dataset entity - it can be used for making changes with the labels and attributes which are ultimately linked to it through the recipe and its ontology.

    ## Cloning Recipes
    When you want to create a new recipe thatâ€™s only slightly different from an existing recipe, it can be easier to start by cloning the original recipe and then making changes on its clone.
    shallow: If True, link to existing ontology,
                  If false clone all ontologies that are links to the recipe as well.
